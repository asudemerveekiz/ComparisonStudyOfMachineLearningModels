# ComparisonStudyOfMachineLearningModels
In this study, 5 different machine learning models were run on the laptop dataset and the success of each was measured.

The models used are as follows:
1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Trees
3) Random Forest
4) Support Vector Machine
5) K Nearest Neighbor

First, 10-fold cross-validation was performed on the dataset, then the 5 models mentioned above were examined on the basis of the following 4 processes, and the results were compared.
1) No additional action was taken in the first operation.
2) Normalization was performed in the second operation.
3) In the third process, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) was performed.
4) The last operation is feature selection.
